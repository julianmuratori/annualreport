						<p>The Jewish Foundation of Greater Toronto is in the happiness business. It works like this.</p>
						<p>Generous members of our community like you open a Donor Advised Fund or make a Planned Gift such as a gift in your Will or an insurance policy with the Foundation. Our donors do this because they want to make sure the causes they care about continue to be funded and thrive, and they want to leave a philanthropic legacy to inspire others to follow their example. They want one place to go to for their philanthropic planning and they want simplicity and cost efficiency.</p>
						<p>The Foundation supports a myriad of charities based on the recommendations provided by our donors either when their Fund is established or throughout the year. In the last fiscal year, our donors distributed approximately <span class="redSpan spanBold">$22.5 million to many worthy causes.</span></p>
						<p>The Foundation’s assets are pooled and invested with the oversight of an Investment Advisory Committee and the Trustees. <span class="redSpan spanBold">The return on the Foundation’s portfolio for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was 10.2%.</span> This means most  of our Funds were larger at the end of the year than they were at the beginning even after making the distributions as recommended by the donor. Everyone should be happy with that!</p>
						<p>The Foundation has hardworking professionals, trustees, committee members and volunteers who work tirelessly on all of the important initiatives that help the Foundation run so well.</p>
						<p>So why are we in the happiness business? Our donors are happy because they are helping support what they care about; they are helping others, our community and Israel. All of us involved with the Foundation are happy because we are helping our donors be happy. And finally, the recipients of the distributions are happy because they receive funds that they need to carry on their important work.</p>
						<p>Happiness is an infinite game. More is better. If you are happy with your experience at the Foundation, please tell others. Together, we can continue to help our community and Israel. Together, we can continue to spread happiness.</p>

										<h6 class="noBold">Holocaust survivors show remarkable resilience in their day to day lives. As survivors age and face new challenges, such as retirement, poor health or losing a spouse, the pain of the past often surfaces. During the Holocaust, survivors knew the ability to look after themselves was vital for survival. Facing the loss of independence and having to rely on someone else to assist with daily living tasks is often very difficult. Support for Holocaust survivors requires a special understanding, knowledge and sensitivity. Donors at the Jewish Foundation responded to the need to ensure that services such as personal care and homemaking, Kosher Meals on Wheels and transportation are readily available to as many survivors as possible. The assistance made possible though the Jewish Foundation allows these survivors to age with dignity, in their own homes.</h6>
